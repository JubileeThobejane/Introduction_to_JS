/* I will log console.log(Product 2), fall through and evalutates
the next case clause, falls through that clause and console.log('Product not found!')
This occurs because the break statements was not added to the end of each case clause
NB ! it will also console.log(Product 3) because JavaScript doesn't care that the
criteria for extra case clauses don't match our serial value
