/*All components used in a for loop are conditional (initial var/initializer) , a condition in which the loop 
terminates(conditonal) and an update of the initial var(increments) . This loop has all of that except that 
the update to the var is found in the call to console.log .
This will be the output:
1 
2
3
4 
5 then terminate */
